  <p>I am a 22 year old who is currently looking to get into the tech space as a web developer and later transition into software development. In the past two years I have opened two companies WGAA which is a real estate investing company with my
    best friend and business partner Oscar. As well as MVI which is an ecommerce business, I also work full time as a car salesman at Shamaley Buick GMC. My hobbies include going to the gym to workout and doing things in my 4Runner such as offroading
    and trailing. I have two companions in my life my lovely girlfriend Athziry and the goodest boy ever Koda. </p>
